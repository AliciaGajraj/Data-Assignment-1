    <div class="intro-text">
      <p>Norma Andrea Gómez, a babysitter, from Woodside, Queens, lost everything when her basement submerged with water because of Hurricane Ida.
      </p>
      <p>The storm made landfall in New York on Wednesday night, September 1st. The remnants of the hurricane flooded roads and apartments,<a href="https://apnews.com/article/northeast-us-new-york-new-jersey-weather-60327279197e14b9d17632ea0818f51c">killing 13 people in New York, 11 of which succumbed to the flooding in their basements,</a> according to the Associated Press.
      </p>
      <p>Gómez was fortunate to escape from her basement in Queens with the help of her neighbors, albeit she is currently without an apartment and her personal belongings. Like many others, she knew New York was expecting a storm on Wednesday night, but she was not worried because where she lived, “nothing like this has happened before.”
      </p>
      <p> Gómez was scared, she lived in her apartment for 11 years, and now, she must find a new place. She recalled, “getting home at 7 p.m. from work,” and the rain was pouring abnormally. Gómez fell asleep at 9:30 p.m. and woke up 30 minutes later to a “loud noise knocking on her door.” She tried to open her door, but she realized water was already in her basement.
      </p>
      <p> In her pajamas, Gómez grabbed her cell phone and keys, and tried to exit from the basement. While opening her door, she saw her Landlord with a broom trying to stop the rain from getting into her apartment. At that moment, Gomez realized, that it was “impossible and “unnecessary” for her to recover her items from the basement.
      </p>

      <p> She stayed on the 2nd floor with her neighbors and returned to her apartment on Thursday morning. Her apartment was in disarray. Gómez’s fridge, couch, and belongings were on the floor covered in water. She managed to save her credit cards and some important documents, but none of her clothing.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a result of the hurricane, Gómez is looking for a new home. The basement that she lived in for 11 years will have to be demolished because of the damage of Hurricane Ida. She has only one item of clothing that she is wearing, some important documents, and a card that she is using for all essential needs. Gomez has set up a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/i-lost-everything-during-hurricane-ida?member=13705473&sharetype=teams&utm_campaign=p_na+share-sheet&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer">GoFundMe page</a> for donations that would help her recover the things she lost to Hurricane Ida.
      </p>

      <p> The aftermath of Hurricane Ida encouraged President Biden’s visit to New York on Tuesday, September 1st. President Biden assessed the damages in Queens, New York and shortly after, held a news conference about scientific research that shows some neighborhoods are vulnerable to extreme weather events. Biden also highlighted an infrastructure bill that he promised would help safeguard against future storms. According to an article by NBC, Hurricane Ida is expected to fall in the range of $17 billion to $25 billion of total property damage or destruction inflicted by hurricanes.
